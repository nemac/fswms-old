OLD REPO --- DO NOT USE
==========================

This is an old copy of the fswms repo that I converted from svn to git.  It has been replaced by the new
repo named 'fswms', which incorporates several commits made to the svn repo in the last few months.  I am
keeping this repo around temporarily in order to provide access to the edited 'version' and 'fswms' scripts
that it contains.  Once we get whatever we need out of those scripts, this repo should be deleted.
